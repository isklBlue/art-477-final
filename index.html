        <p>In 1910, English physiologist Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer discovered a new hormone while conducting research on the human pancreas. He observed the new hormone solely in patients who were not diagnosed with diabetes. The newly discovered hormone was named insulin, derived from the Latin word insula, meaning island. This refers to the location within the pancreas in which insulin is produced, the islets of Langerhans.</p>

        <p>Insulin has since been found to allow the body to use glucose from ingested carbohydrates for energy, and decrease the level of glucose concentration in the blood. While it is the most common treatment for diabetes during the current day, this was not always the case. Before insulin injection therapy became popularized in the late 1920’s, a method of severe calorie restriction was used to control blood glucose concentration in patients with diabetes. Patients were starved in order to lower the amount of glucose taken into the bloodstream, preventing any dangerous blood glucose levels from occurring. Although this did not prove very effective when put into practice, it was seen as the only viable method of treating diabetes at the time, and was therefore widely accepted in the medical community.</p>

        <p>By 1921, researchers Frederick Banting, MD, and Charles Best, MD, had successfully extracted insulin from canine pancreases, and were experimenting by treating diabetic dogs with insulin and monitoring the effects on their blood glucose levels. The team noticed that it was indeed effective in lowering the blood glucose levels of animals, and proceeded onto test it on a human for the first time in early 1922. The pair of researchers tested the substance on themselves to make sure there were no side effects in humans, and then administered it to Leonard Thompson, a 14-year old Canadian who was diagnosed with diabetes. The insulin injections proved effective in lowering the patient’s blood glucose levels, and Dr. Banting was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for this achievement.</p>
