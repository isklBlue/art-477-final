          <p>In 1910, English physiologist Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer discovered a new hormone while conducting research on the human pancreas. He observed the new hormone solely in patients who were not diagnosed with diabetes. The newly discovered hormone was named insulin, derived from the Latin word insula, meaning island. This refers to the location within the pancreas in which insulin is produced, the islets of Langerhans.</p>

          <p>Insulin has since been found to allow the body to use glucose from ingested carbohydrates for energy, and decrease the level of glucose concentration in the blood. While it is the most common treatment for diabetes during the current day, this was not always the case. Before insulin injection therapy became popularized in the late 1920’s, a method of severe calorie restriction was used to control blood glucose concentration in patients with diabetes. Patients were starved in order to lower the amount of glucose taken into the bloodstream, preventing any dangerous blood glucose levels from occurring. Although this did not prove very effective when put into practice, it was seen as the only viable method of treating diabetes at the time, and was therefore widely accepted in the medical community.</p>

          <p>By 1921, researchers Frederick Banting, MD, and Charles Best, MD, had successfully extracted insulin from canine pancreases, and were experimenting by treating diabetic dogs with insulin and monitoring the effects on their blood glucose levels. The team noticed that it was indeed effective in lowering the blood glucose levels of animals, and proceeded onto test it on a human for the first time in early 1922. The pair of researchers tested the substance on themselves to make sure there were no side effects in humans, and then administered it to Leonard Thompson, a 14-year old Canadian who was diagnosed with diabetes. The insulin injections proved effective in lowering the patient’s blood glucose levels, and Dr. Banting was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for this achievement.</p>

          <p>Insulin began being commercially produced later in the same year by Eli Lilly and Company. By the late 1920’s, other various drug manufacturing companies had followed suit, making insulin readily available for diabetes patients. The introduction of insulin allowed for the death rate of diabetes-related complications to decrease from 82.4% in 1914 to 0.1% in 1950.</p>

          <p>In order to determine the current concentration of glucose in one’s blood, the blood must be tested with either a digital glucose meter or chemical test, such as urine testing strips. Urine test strips were introduced for the measuring blood glucose concentration in 1941. These strips were produced by various manufacturers and allowed patients to determine their blood glucose levels much more accurately than in the past. This also helped them determine how much insulin to administer, since higher concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream require more insulin to regulate than lower glucose concentrations.</p>
          <p>The next significant discovery in the field of diabetes treatment came in 1959, when Solomon Berson, MD, and Rosalyn Yalow, PhD, discovered that patients could either be completely insulin-dependent or still produce some insulin within the pancreas. They coined the terms “type 1” and “type 2” for the two different types of diabetes they had discovered. Type 1 diabetics are insulin-dependent, whereas type 2 diabetics are non-insulin dependent. Insulin injection therapy is much more common in type 1 patients than in type 2 patients.</p>

          <p>The first blood glucose meter was produced in 1970 by the Ames Company. This early model was only designed for use in hospital settings, and the blood glucose meter was not available for home use until 1981. This advancement in technology allowed patients to measure their blood glucose levels much more accurately than before, with more accurate and advanced models being released to this day. Blood glucose concentration is typically measured in milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL. Modern blood glucose meters measure as accurately as +/- 20 mg/dL, which is a significant improvement from previous methods used to measure blood glucose concentration.</p>

          <p>Soon after the electronic blood glucose meter was introduced, a device called the Biostator was created in 1974. This device monitored the patient’s blood glucose levels continuously, becoming what would be known as the world’s first continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Continuous glucose monitoring proved to be a significant advancement in the field, since it meant the patient’s blood glucose concentration was known at all times by both the doctor and the patient. This machine also introduced closed-loop insulin infusion, which means that the machine automated insulin delivery by controlling the plunger on a syringe filled with insulin. By combining the CGM and insulin infusion technologies, this machine was the first prototype of an artificial pancreas system in the world.</p>
          <p>The Biostator system was not made widely available to patients despite its significant advancements in the field of diabetes treatment. In 1976, the first wearable insulin pump was designed, working much like the Biostator except on a smaller scale. These early insulin infusion pumps were capable of delivering insulin at an automated rate and more precisely than by manual injection.</p>

          <p>The development of insulin infusion pump technology continued throughout the 1980s and 90s, but insulin pumps were not widely used until the early 2000’s. The first commercially successful insulin pump, the Minimed 502, became available in 1983, guiding the way for many other companies to release and continue improving upon the design and functionality of these devices.</p>
          <p>In 1999, the FDA approved the first continuous glucose monitoring system for commercial use. Medtronic, along with other companies, began releasing CGM models designed for public use, and CGM use has increased exponentially since 2005 due to their increasing accuracy and convenience for everyday use.</p>

          <p>In 2006, Medtronic released the Minimed Paradigm REAL-Time System, the first commercially available insulin pump to be integrated with continuous glucose monitoring technology. The pump would allow the wearer to see their blood glucose levels on the device screen.</p>
          <p>By 2009, Medtronic released the Minimed VEO, which added the feature to suspend insulin delivery when the connected CGM delivered a hypoglycemic blood glucose reading, preventing the wearer from recieving more insulin until their blood glucose returned to a safe level. However, this technology would not be available in the United States until 2013.</p>

          <p>In the coming years, we will begin to see closed-loop insulin pump technology advance at an exponential rate. In 2022, Tandem is expected to release the first every smartphone app able to remotely control an insulin pump, meaning users will be able to administer insulin by simply using the app.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Dexcom is expected to release the G7 CGM system, which will be smaller, thinner, and faster than the current G6 device. Sooner rather than later, fingersticks will become a thing of the past, and diabetics will be able to rely on automated systems to regulate their blood sugar levels, much like the pancreas does.</p>
